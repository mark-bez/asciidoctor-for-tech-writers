= Writing a simple document
:toc:

We'll start with a simple document written with the simplest of tools.

== What you'll need

To write the AsciiDoc we'll use a basic text editor.
The examples below show Windows Notepad, but if you work on a Mac you might use TextEdit.

To show what the HTML created from the AsciiDoc document looks like, we'll use either Chrome, Firefox, or Opera browser with an installed extension called Asciidoctor.js Live Preview.

== How to do it

. Download preview extension for Chrome or Firefox.


In Chrome:
. Type `chrome://extensions/` to open the Extensions page.
. Click the settings menu

. Need to set the requirement in Chrome "Allow access to file urls"
. Open Notepad in Windows or EditPad in Apple
*** Re-create example-1.adoc
** What can you do with this?
*** Copy the entire text from the browser and paste it into an email. Nicely formatted. Can adjust the formatting.
