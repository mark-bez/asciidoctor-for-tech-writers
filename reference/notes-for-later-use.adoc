== Converting to .docx
Add this to my asciidoc notes files

INPUT_ADOC=my_input_file.adoc
asciidoctor --backend docbook --out-file - $INPUT_ADOC|pandoc --from docbook --to docx --output $INPUT_ADOC.docx

== Document structure
The high level structure is:

* Header
** Title
** Document attributes
**
* Section 1
** Section 1 title
** Section 1 body
* Section 2
** Section 2 title
** Section 2 body, and so on

The blank line is needed


If you have heading levels out of order, say a heading 3 without a heading 2 above it, you can still create an output, but AsciiDoc processors will warn you that you have the structure out of sequence.
This is a great thing because it doesn't hold up your work, but still helps you write your document with a logically correct structure.
